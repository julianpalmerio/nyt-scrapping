# New York Times Web Scrapping Robot

The main goal of this robot is to download news from the new york times website.

The robot was made with pure python (conda) and the Selenium library present in the RPAframework libraries. I think it could be simpler if I had used more third party libraries to extract and transform the data like Pandas, or some libraries to parse the dates.

You can change the search phrase, the section and the months to retrieve in the configuration file located in /devdata/work-items-in/configuration/work-items.json.

It remains to write the corresponding tests.
